You are tasked with generating comprehensive test cases based on formal specifications.

Problem Description:
Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
(leftover part always smaller than 1).

Return the decimal part of the number.
>>> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5

Method Signature:
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float

Formal Specifications (Corrected and Validated):
```python
# Corrected Specifications for HumanEval_2: truncate_number
# Problem: Return the decimal part of a positive floating point number
# Signature: def truncate_number(number: float) -> float
# Let 'res' denote the expected return value
# All specifications were correct - no corrections needed

# Specification 1: Result is the decimal part
assert res == (number - int(number))  # Result equals the number minus its integer part

# Specification 2: Result range constraint
assert 0 <= res < 1  # Decimal part must be between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)

# Specification 3: Reconstruction property
assert number == int(number) + res  # Original number can be reconstructed from integer part and result

# Specification 4: Non-negativity
assert res >= 0  # Decimal part is always non-negative

# Specification 5: Integer input handling
assert (number == int(number)) <= (res == 0)  # If input is an integer, result should be 0
```

TASK:
Generate comprehensive test cases that verify each specification above. 

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create test functions using pytest format
2. Each test should clearly verify one or more specifications
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Label each test with a comment indicating which specification(s) it tests
5. Use descriptive test function names that explain what is being tested
6. Include edge cases and boundary conditions
7. Import the function at the top of the file

TEST FILE STRUCTURE:
```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'solutions'))
from HumanEval_2 import truncate_number

def test_truncate_number_<descriptive_name>():
    '''Test specification 1: <which spec this tests>'''
    # Test code here
    result = truncate_number(input_args)
    assert result == expected_output
```

IMPORTANT:
- Generate 8-12 test functions
- Cover all specifications comprehensively
- Include edge cases (empty inputs, None, boundary values, etc.)
- Ensure tests are runnable with pytest
- Each test should be independent and self-contained
- Use clear, descriptive test names
