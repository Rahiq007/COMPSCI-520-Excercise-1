You are tasked with generating comprehensive test cases based on formal specifications.

Problem Description:
Check if two words have the same characters.
>>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
True
>>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
True
>>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
True
>>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
False
>>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
False
>>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
False

Method Signature:
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str)

Formal Specifications (Corrected and Validated):
```python
# Corrected Specifications for HumanEval_54: same_chars
# Problem: Check if two words have the same characters.
# Signature: def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str)
# Let 'res' denote the expected return value
# All specifications were correct - no corrections needed

# Specification 1: Core property - result equals set equality
assert res == (set(s0) == set(s1))  # Result must be True iff both strings have identical character sets

# Specification 2: Result is boolean type
assert isinstance(res, bool)  # Result must be a boolean value

# Specification 3: Symmetric property
assert res == (set(s1) == set(s0))  # Function is symmetric - order of arguments doesn't matter

# Specification 4: Empty string handling
assert (len(s0) == 0 and len(s1) == 0) <= (res == True)  # Two empty strings should return True

# Specification 5: Character count independence
assert res == (len(set(s0) & set(s1)) == len(set(s0)) and len(set(s0) & set(s1)) == len(set(s1)))  # Intersection of character sets equals both individual sets
```

TASK:
Generate comprehensive test cases that verify each specification above. 

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create test functions using pytest format
2. Each test should clearly verify one or more specifications
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Label each test with a comment indicating which specification(s) it tests
5. Use descriptive test function names that explain what is being tested
6. Include edge cases and boundary conditions
7. Import the function at the top of the file

TEST FILE STRUCTURE:
```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'solutions'))
from HumanEval_54 import same_chars

def test_same_chars_<descriptive_name>():
    '''Test specification 1: <which spec this tests>'''
    # Test code here
    result = same_chars(input_args)
    assert result == expected_output
```

IMPORTANT:
- Generate 8-12 test functions
- Cover all specifications comprehensively
- Include edge cases (empty inputs, None, boundary values, etc.)
- Ensure tests are runnable with pytest
- Each test should be independent and self-contained
- Use clear, descriptive test names
