Problem description: Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
(leftover part always smaller than 1).

Return the decimal part of the number.
>>> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5

Method signature: def truncate_number(number: float) -> float

Please write formal specifications as Python assertions that describe the correct behavior of this method.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Write specifications as assert statements
2. Let 'res' denote the expected return value of truncate_number
3. Do NOT call 'truncate_number()' in your assertions (no self-reference)
4. Do NOT use methods with side effects such as:
   - print(), input(), file operations
   - random number generation (random.random())
   - timing functions (time.time(), datetime.now())
   - data structure modifications (list.append(), dict.update(), set.add())
5. Express relationships using ONLY pure arithmetic and boolean logic

Generate approximately 5 formal specifications that capture key properties of this function.

Format each specification as:
assert <logical_expression>  # Comment explaining what this checks

Example format (do not use this exact assertion, generate appropriate ones for the problem):
assert res == (n % 2 == 0)  # Result must equal "n is divisible by 2"
